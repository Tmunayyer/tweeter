# Propoganda Bonanza

## Description

Demonstration of a general approach I would take setting up a new application and building out some new components. What started out as a barebones project turned into an initial exploration and first implementation of new React concepts like hooks and context.

### Note

Because I took some extra time on the frontend, the backend is a bit more sparse than I hoped when I started. The next thing I would do is include a database and an authentication system to allow multiple users.

## Installation

1. Install modules

```
$ npm install
```

2. Start the application

```
$ npm start
```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/
